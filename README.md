# Goal
Copies Windows 10 lock screen wallpaper images to a designated location
- These images get refreshed frequently by Windows and the old ones get deleted
- They are generally very pretty and useful as desktop or phone backgrounds

### Duplication prevention
Only those images not yet available in the designated location are being copied

## Assumptions
- Your windows drive is C
- If no destination folders given, storage will be on your desktop folder
